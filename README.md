Carpooling service created with Meteor/MongoDB

Carpooling service which allows a user to create a carpool, invite people to carpool.

Each user can then provide their availability.

An admin user, this being a user whose firstName is 'Admin' (temporary hack), can then go and see availability for all users, and select who should do the carpool each day based on that, and provide the results

-- This was done as a project for the class 'Create a New Venture' - STRAMGT 321 at the Stanford GSB.
